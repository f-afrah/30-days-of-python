# Day 2: Variables & String Formatting
## What I learnt:
How to use variables for text and numbers.
How to combine variables with text using f-strings for cleaner output.
Using string methods (.upper(), .lower(), .title()) inside and outside f-strings and understanding how placement affects results.
Performing basic calculations with variables (area, perimeter, age projections, temperature conversion).
Counting occurrences of a letter in a string using .count().
How to create dynamic, readable sentences by combining multiple variables and string methods.

## Challenges:
Remembering to recalculate dependent variables (like letter counts) when the input changes.
Understanding the difference between concatenation (+) and f-strings, and which is cleaner for longer sentences.
Deciding when to apply string methods inside {} versus outside the string.

## Next steps:
Practice combining more variables and calculations in single sentences.
Try using user input to make sentences fully dynamic.
Explore additional string methods, like .replace() or .strip(), to manipulate text.
