# Day 3: Conditionals & User Input

## What I learnt:

- How to use input() to take information from the user and store it in variables.
- How to convert input to different types (e.g., int()) for calculations.
- Using if, elif, and else to create mutually exclusive conditional logic.
- Checking multiple conditions using comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==) and logical operators (and).
- Using % to check if a number is even or odd.
- How to format strings using .title() and .strip() to clean and present user input.
  
## Challenges:

- Remembering that input() always returns a string, so conversion is needed for numerical operations.
- Understanding that elif should be used instead of multiple ifs for mutually exclusive conditions.
- Ensuring string formatting works correctly with user input.
  
## Next steps:

- Practice combining conditionals with loops.
- Try nested conditionals and multiple user inputs in one program.
- Prepare for Day 4 by exploring while and for loops.
